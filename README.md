# EXPIREMINDER

## Expiration date notifier

**Overview**:
- A program that allows users to track and add items to their own custom categories
  and receive an email notification once they reached the set amount of time before its expiry date.

- This program is intended to be accessible to all,
so that it can be used by anyone who wants to keep track of their items' expiration dates and receive notifications 
before they expire. This may include individuals who want to ensure their personal items such as
foods, supplements and medicine, skincare products, or important documents, as well as 
businesses that want to keep track of their inventory expiration dates.

- This project was inspired by my recent personal experience of finding expired oatmeal in my dorm room.
The frustration is real lol, and I can relate to the need for an application like ExpiReminder.
I plan to use this app myself to keep track of my own items and ensure that I am aware of them before they expire.
